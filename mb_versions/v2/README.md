# Main Board v2
This is the second version of the Main Board PCB for the sensor display.

## Changes from v1
* Removed second header for sensor module since it isn't necessary for this current PCB
* Removed Test Points and replaced it with a 2x4 female header since it's less clunky
* Exposed the transmission pins (TX/RX)
* Added a top and bottom copper area.
